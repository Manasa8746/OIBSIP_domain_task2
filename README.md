🏷️ Project Title: Unemployment Analysis with Python

🎯 Objective
    To analyze the unemployment trends across different regions of India and build a predictive model to estimate unemployment rates based on employment and labour participation  data.
    This project also visualizes patterns and relationships between key emp

🧩 Steps Performed
Data Loading & Cleaning:
Imported dataset (Unemployment in India.csv) using Pandas.
Removed unwanted spaces and special characters from column names.
Handled missing values and converted date columns into proper datetime format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Visualized unemployment trends over time using Seaborn Line Plot.
  Compared average unemployment rates by region and area (Urban/Rural).
  Generated a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between factors.
Feature Selection & Modeling:
  Selected relevant features: EstimatedEmployed and EstimatedLabourParticipationRate.
  Built a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn to predict unemployment rate.
Model Evaluation:
  Evaluated model performance using R² Score, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MSE (Mean Squared Error).
  Visualized the comparison between actual vs predicted unemployment rates.
Prediction:
Predicted unemployment rate for sample input values (employment and labour rate).

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
 pandas – for data handling
 numpy – for numerical computation
 matplotlib, seaborn – for visualization
 scikit-learn – for machine learning and model evaluation

📈 Output:
  Cleaned and structured dataset ready for analysis.
  Visual insights into unemployment trends by region and area.
  Strong correlation observed between employment, labour participation, and unemployment rate.
  Developed a Linear Regression model to predict unemployment rate with good accuracy.
  Enhanced understanding of real-world data analysis, visualization, and ML modeling.

🧠 Key Learnings
  Data preprocessing and cleaning for better accuracy.
  Visualizing data insights effectively with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
